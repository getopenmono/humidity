# Humidity & temperature app for Mono

This app works with the DHT22 (AM2302) and DHT11 humidity and temperature sensors.

See [the tutorial](http://developer.openmono.com/en/latest/tutorials/tutorials.html#humidty-app) on the [developer site](http://developer.openmono.com) for a an explanation of how (a simplified version of) this app works.

In this version of the app, you can also connect a push button through the mini jack between `RING1` and `GND`, which will make it possible to switch between temperature units.
